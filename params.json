I found myself writing my own \r\nlibrary to create some common intents I was using across projects, so we decided to push that code to a project everyone could contribute to.\r\n\r\nHere are some sample factory methods that will allow you to do some simple things:\r\n\r\n- Send emails: \r\n\r\n    `startActivity( EmailIntents.newEmailIntent( \"me@example.com\", \"My subject\", \"Hey there!\" ) );`\r\n\r\n- Use the phone:\r\n\r\n    `startActivity( PhoneIntents.newCallNumberIntent( \"123456789\" ) );`\r\n\t\r\n    `startActivity( PhoneIntents.newSmsIntent( \"123456789\", \"Hi!\" ) );`\r\n\t\r\n- Display an address on a map:\r\n\r\n    `startActivity( GeoIntents.newMapsIntent( \"Mus√©e du Louvre 75058 Paris\", \"Le Louvre\" ) );`\r\n\t\r\n- Open your application on the available market application (be it Google Play, Amazon, ...):\r\n\r\n    `startActivity( SystemIntents.newMarketForAppIntent( getApplicationContext() );`\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\nThis project has now been initiated with a few intents but we are looking forward to integrating your own intents to ease each developer's life.\r\n\r\nSome rules for contributors: \r\n\r\n- If the intent you are creating does not fit into any of the provided utility classes (EmailIntents, GeoIntents, ...), do not hesitate to create your own. \r\nThose classes are meant to be simple factories with only static methods.\r\n- If the intent you are creating is specific to an application (like a particular Twitter client), please put the utility class in a sub-package named after \r\nthat application.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get the library included in your project is by using Gradle. Simply add the following line to your dependencies block:\r\n\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        compile 'com.marvinlabs:android-intents:1.2.+@aar'\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nOf course, you can replace the version number by whichever version you need (you can have a look at this repository's tags to know which is the latest).\r\n\r\n## About Vincent & MarvinLabs\r\n\r\nI am a freelance developer located in Biarritz, France.
